This project shows snake game written in C++. In this project, it allows me to practice basic C++ programming including define header file,OOP inheritance concept, class/object implementation, struct usage, switch/auto usage etc.

There are four steps:
1. Initialization:
   * initialize snake variable and assign values to variables. 
2. layout:
   * layout function is used for drawing the snake map and update food/snake tail.
4. input:
   * input function is used for controlling the direction of snake. you can press 'q' to quit the game.
6. logic:
   * logic function is used for detecting snake direction and generating another location of food when snake ate food.
