Snake game written in C++

Here are three foodtype:
1. F: the snake tail becomes 'o' and increase one tail when snake ate food ***F*** each time.
2. Q: the snake tail becomes '@' and increase two tail when snake ate food ***Q*** each time.
3. *: the snake tail becomes '+' and increase three tail when snake ate food * each time.
* foodtype => tailtype, F => o, Q => @, * => +

There are four steps in workflow:
1. Initialization:
   * initialize snake variable and assign values to variables. 
2. layout:
   * layout function is used for drawing the snake map and update food/snake tail.
4. input:
   * input function is used for controlling the direction of snake. you can press 'q' to quit the game.
6. logic:
   * logic function is used for detecting snake direction and generating another location of food when snake ate food.


This project shows snake game written in C++. In this project, it allows me to practice basic C++ programming including define header file,OOP inheritance concept, class/object implementation, struct usage, switch/auto usage etc.
